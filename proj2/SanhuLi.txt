was very small, and I lived on a street called Fayette St., and it had a wonderful maple tree in the front and I liked to climb it, I was a tomboy. So one of my favorite things do to was, you know, roller-skate and climb trees. I had a little, I have three brothers, at the time when I was smaller I only had two because my youngest brother Jimmy hadn't been born yet. So my younger brother Jimmy and I, and the next door neighbors would play, and I guess, really Buckhannon was like a very wonderful town to grow up in because there wasn't a lot of crime it was just very safe, a very safe place. How long have you lived in Lincolnton, NC? Nine years. OK, Um, you're now married to the man that you dated in high school. How did you meet him in high school? Well, actually I met him in junior high. And I was in the seventh grade and he was in the ninth grade. And, um, at lunchtime what we did was we would go to the gym and everybody would eat their lunch in the gym on the bleachers and they would have, they would play records and then the kids would dance. Of course, you know, I was very skinny, I was cute but not the kind of girl that guys were looking at, and, I but I used to watch your dad dance with all the other girls and he was a wonderful dancer and I really liked him. Used to sit and look at the kids dance and I'd listen to Beetles songs. I would look at Larry and I had picked him as the one I'd always wanted to dance with and it wasn't until we got into high school that he noticed me. And I was in a a talent show with my girlfriend and we did a modern dance to "Pink Panther," and after that my phone didn't stop ringing for awhile. And your dad called me and asked me if I wanted to go out with is best friend Tom Rigger, and I said, "Never." This guy was not my type and so he said, "Would you like to go out with me?" and I said, "Yes, I would," and so that's when we started dating. Why did you like him? Besides
